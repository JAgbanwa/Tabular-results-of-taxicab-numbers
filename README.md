# Tabular-results-of-taxicab-numbers
This repository is purposely to contain the tabular results of closed form generator of taxicab numbers in [this paper] of the form

$A(c_1,m)^3 + B(c_1,m)^3 = C(c_1,m)^3 + D(c_1,m)^3$ for $m = 2,3,4,5,6,7,8$.

This repository also contains a folder of Magma verifications of the families of taxicab numbers for each case of m from m = 2,...,8
to further confirm the correctness of these results.
